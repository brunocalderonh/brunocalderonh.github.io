This papers analyzes wage dynamics in Mexico from a structural perspective, exploring how digital skills, work experience, and geographical location influence workers’ earnings. Using microdata from the National Employment and Occupation Survey (ENOE), an econometric model based on Mincer equations was employed, extended through a Seemingly Unrelated Regressions (SUR) methodology, to identify key factors determining wage inequality in digital and non-digital jobs.
