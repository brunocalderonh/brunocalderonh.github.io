This text explores the dynamics of human capital and income inequality, contrasting developed countries and developing nations like Mexico. While in developed nations, the increase in wage premiums for skilled labor, marked by advanced education and cognitive abilities, contributes to growing income inequality, the scenario in Mexico is starkly different. Here, income inequality is more attributed to the concentration of wealth among a small elite, rather than the wage premiums associated with education and skills. Despite a rise in skilled labor, underemployment and low wages persist, underscoring the nuanced and complex relationship between human capital, economic growth, and income inequality in different economic landscapes.
