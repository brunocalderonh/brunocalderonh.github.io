In today’s fast-paced digital era, where technological revolutions occur at an unprecedented rate, the figure of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) has emerged with force. Although they have captured the interest of both the crypto and artistic fields, their arrival has not been without questions. Imagine NFTs as digital certificates of authenticity. Thanks to blockchain technology, the uniqueness of a digital asset—whether it be a piece of art, a song, a video, or even a tweet—can be certified. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, where each unit has an equivalent value, each NFT is unique and unrepeatable. These cryptographic assets on blockchain, with Ethereum leading the way, are identified by non-transferable codes. Their scope is broad, representing everything from artistic pieces and video game items to event tickets and domain names.

NFTs have brought a wave of innovations and possibilities. By bypassing traditional intermediaries, they are revolutionizing the art world, creating a direct bridge between artists and a global audience. This phenomenon guarantees the exclusivity of artworks and effectively combats forgeries and copyright infringements. Additionally, they transcend boundaries, expanding their utility from digital exhibitions to video games. It is through resales that they can generate ongoing benefits for artists, highlighting the importance of their creative work over time. Thanks to blockchain technology, every NFT transaction is recorded, offering impeccable traceability.

However, like any innovation, NFTs bring certain challenges. The market volatility is evident, and many see parallels between the NFT fever and past financial bubbles, questioning the sustainability of the astronomical prices of some pieces. Added to this is the youth of the NFT market, which still lacks solid regulation, potentially fostering dubious practices or even scams. We cannot ignore its ecological impact either, as NFT transactions, especially on Ethereum, generate considerable debate due to their carbon footprint. The improper tokenization of artworks has also led to disputes and controversies regarding intellectual property rights. Incidents such as DeFi NFT scams, the Birkin Bag case, or fraud involving Banksy’s works are examples of how enthusiasm can be exploited by malicious actors.

In conclusion, the NFT universe offers a wide range of opportunities and challenges. It represents another step in digital evolution, but like any innovation, it requires caution and education. Enthusiasm is valid, but it must always go hand in hand with prudence.[^1]
