At the onset of the boom in early 2022, financial markets were already anticipating a bullish phase for U.S. arms manufacturers, a trend that materialized with Russia’s military intervention in Ukraine on February 24. From that moment, there was a noticeable increase in the stock prices of aerospace and defense corporations such as Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, which surged by over 20%. This growth was further fueled by Western solidarity, manifested in the supply of advanced military equipment to Ukraine—marking not only a geopolitical commitment but also the material interest of the private arms sector in the market.

One year later, in February 2023, the first anniversary of the conflict coincided with a continued upward trend for defense companies. European firms such as Saab and Rheinmetall saw a notable multiplication in their stock value, reinforced by a speech from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that evoked a narrative of “resilience” and “unity.” However, the industry also began facing significant challenges, including supply chain disruptions that interrupted the upward trajectory of profits for the sector’s leading companies.

In 2023, crucial questions emerged about the long-term impact of the Ukrainian conflict on the arms industry. Experts foresee sustained expansion, driven by the exponential growth of global military budgets. The circumstances indicate that the Ukrainian crisis has catalyzed a golden era for the industry, significantly reshaping economic and political dynamics on a global scale.

Despite the prevailing optimism, the resurgence of the sector comes with several difficulties, such as logistical challenges and supply chain obstacles that have slowed the production of military equipment. Small suppliers are particularly at risk, facing material inflation and high labor costs. However, these challenges are expected to be temporary, paving the way for a revenue rebound once these issues are resolved.

The U.S. defense budget for 2024 is projected to exceed $842 billion, with the total market capitalization potentially reaching $1.25 trillion. The expansion of the arms industry raises profound ethical and humanitarian concerns, as it is sustained by an environment of escalating conflict and geopolitical tensions..[^1]
