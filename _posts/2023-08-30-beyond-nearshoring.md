Despite the enthusiasm surrounding the rise of nearshoring and Mexico’s consolidation as a key trade partner of the United States, it is crucial to consider the global landscape and the risks of this dynamic. Mexico has strengthened its presence in global trade, but this progress does not necessarily indicate autonomous and robust economic development. The heavy reliance on the maquiladora industry demonstrates an economy that exports goods with limited added value, without focusing on boosting productivity and endogenous growth, as proposed by the Kaldor-Verdoorn law. This approach has kept Mexico in a cycle of minimal investment in human capital formation and technology.

This export-oriented focus towards the United States has left the Mexican economy vulnerable to external shocks, trade policy changes, and political fluctuations. In the 1950s, Mexico pursued industrialization and was, at the time, more developed than China, which was then an entirely rural country. Today, however, the economy has shifted towards a dominance of maquiladoras which, while providing jobs, do not yield long-term benefits in learning, technology, and productivity growth, as highlighted by the Kaldor-Verdoorn law.

Adding to this challenge is the recent criticism of the restrictive fiscal policy and the current government’s austerity measures. This fiscal approach, rather than providing the necessary stimulus to foster investment and growth, may worsen the situation by restricting spending and public investment. Austerity policies can lead to lower investment in key areas such as education, infrastructure, and healthcare, further limiting the country’s growth potential and exacerbating existing inequalities.

The contrast with China is revealing. The Asian nation has demanded technology transfers in investment agreements, transforming itself into a leader across multiple sectors. Meanwhile, Mexico has relinquished ground, allowing foreign operations without significant transfers, thus limiting its progress in domestic industries.

Mexico’s position as North America’s “workshop” carries consequences. According to the OECD, it is one of the countries with the longest working hours, second only to Colombia. Moreover, in terms of per capita income, it ranks very low compared to other OECD countries. In the long run, this situation is not sustainable for equitable and robust development.

Nearshoring may present immediate benefits for Mexico, but a forward-looking vision that promotes innovation and investment in both education and technology is essential. Kaldor-Verdoorn emphasizes the importance of industrialization and productivity increases for long-term development.

Nearshoring could serve as a window of opportunity for Mexico, but it is crucial to analyze both its benefits and future risks. Simply participating in supply chains does not guarantee sustained and fair development. It is imperative to rethink the growth model and adopt a more comprehensive and enduring strategy. .[^1]
