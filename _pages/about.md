My name is Bruno Calderón Hernández. I hold a Master’s in Applied Economics from ITAM and am currently in the process of completing a Master’s in Economic Theory. My primary research interests lie in Applied, Development, Labor, Urban, and Trade Economics as well as Macroeconomic Forecasting. Additionally, I specialize in causal inference methods.

As a researcher, my ultimate goal is to better understand the underlying structures and mechanisms that perpetuate poverty and inequality, particularly in underdeveloped regions of the world.

Within my webpage you can find my [CV](files/CV.pdf), my and my [current research](https://brunocalderonh.github.io/publications/).
