My name is Bruno Calderón Hernández. I hold a Master’s degree in Applied Economics from ITAM and am currently completing a second Master’s in Economic Theory. My primary research interests lie in causal inference, applied econometrics, and political economy. I am particularly interested in studying the causal mechanisms behind industrial policies and their impact on socioeconomic well-being.

As a researcher, my ultimate goal is to deepen our understanding of the structures and mechanisms that perpetuate poverty and inequality, especially in underdeveloped regions of the world.

Within my webpage you can find my [CV](files/CV.pdf), my and my [current research](https://brunocalderonh.github.io/publications/).
